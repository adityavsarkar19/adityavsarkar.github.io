Hello World! 
I am Aditya and I am a Data Scientist. I have completed my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from [Ashoka University](http://ashoka.edu.in/). I have 3+ years of experience in building Machine Learning, Deep Learning Models and also several data analytics projects. 

I am current working as an Assistant Manager - Data Science at [Genpact](http://genpact.com). I primarily work on building ML models for finding transformation opportunities in many industrial and business process. I am also working on developing Generative AI (LLM) driven platforms to drive transformation processes. 

I am a religious follower of football and spend a good amount of free time watching the game as well as passionately crafting data-driven football articles for [IFTWC](http://iftwc.com) .Beyond the numbers, I'm an ardent movie buff, a chess enthusiast, and an avid trivia virtuoso aka Quizzer, having won several quizzes in school and college had the honour of representing India in the [Quizzing World Cup](http://quizzing.com/category/quizzing-world-cup/) on multiple occasions. 

Check out my [portfolio](http://genpact.com) for all of my projects, skills and achievements. Also, do consider reading my [articles](http://genpact.com) as well. 

Food history and culinary origins fascinate me, making me the ultimate foodie explorer. Join me on a journey where data, football, movies, chess, quizzes, and gastronomy.
